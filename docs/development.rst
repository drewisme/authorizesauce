Development
===========

All assistance is appreciated! New features, documentation fixes, bug reports,
bug fixes, and more are graciously accepted.

Getting started
---------------

To get set up, fork the project on our `Github page`_. You can then
install from source by following the instructions in :doc:`install`. There are
a few additional dependencies for compiling the docs and running the tests:

* mock_
* unittest2_ (if on Python < 2.7)
* sphinx_ (for docs only)

You can install all dependencies using pip_ from the ``requirements.txt``
file:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

.. _Github page: https://github.com/drewisme/authorizesauce
.. _mock: http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/
.. _unittest2: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest2
.. _sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/
.. _pip: http://www.pip-installer.org/

Running the tests
-----------------

Once you're all installed up, ensure that the tests pass by running them. You
can run the local unit tests with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./tests/run_tests.py

However, the above command skips some integration tests that actually hit the
remote Authorize.net test server. This is done so the main test suite can be
run quickly and without an internet connection. However, you should
occasionally run the full test suite, which can be done by setting an
environment variable:

.. code-block:: bash

    AUTHORIZE_LIVE_TESTS=1 ./tests/run_tests.py

Testing in all supported Python versions
----------------------------------------

Since Authorize Sauce supports multiple Python versions, running the tests in
your currently installed Python version may not be enough. You can use `tox`_
to automate running the tests in all supported versions of Python.

First, install tox, if you haven't already:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install tox
    # or easy_install tox

Running it is simple:

.. code-block:: bash

    tox

If you want to only test against a subset of Python versions, you can do so:

.. code-block:: bash

    tox -e py27,py34

As above, you can set an environment variable to run the full test suite in
every supported Python version:

.. code-block:: bash

    AUTHORIZE_LIVE_TESTS=1 tox

**Note**: tox requires that the tested Python versions are already present on
your system.  If you need to install one or more versions of Python, `pyenv`_
or (for Ubuntu) the `deadsnakes PPA`_ can be helpful.

Authorize.net documentation
---------------------------

The Authorize.net documentation somehow manages to be both overly verbose and
fairly uninformative. That said, you can find it here:

* `Developer site`_
* `Advanced Integration Method`_
* `Customer Information Manager`_
* `Automated Recurring Billing`_

.. _Customer Information Manager: http://www.authorize.net/support/CIM_SOAP_guide.pdf
.. _Automated Recurring Billing: http://www.authorize.net/support/ARB_SOAP_guide.pdf

Submitting bugs and patches
---------------------------

If you have a bug to report, please do so on our `Github issues`_ page. If
you've got a fork with a new feature or a bug fix with tests, please send us a
pull request.
