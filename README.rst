Authorize Sauce
===============


ðŸ”¥ WARNING ðŸ”¥
-------
Authorize.Net has deprecated their SOAP APIs and plans to end-of-life them at some point. This applies to the Customer and Recurring APIs in this library. The Transaction API uses AIM and is still currently supported but Authorize.Net recommends using the new API.
See https://developer.authorize.net/api/upgrade_guide/ under `API Support Status`

*Recommend moving to official Authorize.Net SDK for python:*

* https://github.com/AuthorizeNet/sdk-python
* https://github.com/AuthorizeNet/sample-code-python

Also, see the forum issue with the SOAP API:

The secret sauce for accessing the Authorize.net API. The Authorize APIs for
transactions, recurring payments, and saved payments are all different and
awkward to use directly. Instead, you can use Authorize Sauce, which unifies
all three Authorize.net APIs into one coherent Pythonic interface. Charge
credit cards, easily!

::

  >>> # Init the authorize client and a credit card
  >>> from authorize import AuthorizeClient, CreditCard
  >>> client = AuthorizeClient('285tUPuS', '58JKJ4T95uee75wd')
  >>> cc = CreditCard('4111111111111111', '2018', '01', '911', 'Joe', 'Blow')
  >>> card = client.card(cc)

  >>> # Charge a card
  >>> card.capture(100)
  <AuthorizeTransaction 2171829470>

  >>> # Save the card on Authorize servers for later
  >>> saved_card = card.save()
  >>> saved_card.uid
  '7713982|6743206'

  >>> # Use a saved card to auth a transaction, and settle later
  >>> saved_card = client.saved_card('7713982|6743206')
  >>> transaction = saved_card.auth(200)
  >>> transaction.settle()
